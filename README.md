## General info
This project is my personal portfolio website. I really enjoyed working on this project and spent any time I could on it.
* It's a fully responsive front end portolio website.
* Used HTML to built this website and gave a structure to the website 
* Used CSS to design my website at various places like buttons, text alignments, giving different colours to the website etc 
* Used JavaScript to gave some functionality to my webpage such as I had used a scrolling bar in the website that scrolls us to top and I had also used JS in the navbar in fading In and Out.
